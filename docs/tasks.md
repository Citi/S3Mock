# S3Mock Improvement Tasks

This document contains a list of potential improvements for the S3Mock project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Implement support for domain-style access to buckets (e.g., `http://bucket.localhost:9090/someKey`) to better match AWS S3 behavior
2. [ ] Add support for AWS S3 operations that are currently not implemented (e.g., bucket policies, website configuration, etc.)
3. [ ] Implement a plugin architecture to allow for custom extensions and behaviors
4. [ ] Add support for S3 event notifications (SNS, SQS, Lambda)
5. [ ] Improve error handling to more closely match AWS S3 error responses
6. [ ] Implement a metrics collection system to monitor performance and usage
7. [ ] Add support for S3 Select for querying object content
8. [ ] Implement support for S3 Inventory reports
9. [ ] Add support for S3 Analytics configurations
10. [ ] Implement S3 Batch Operations

## Code Quality Improvements

11. [ ] Increase unit test coverage for service and store layers
12. [ ] Refactor synchronization mechanisms in store classes to improve concurrency handling
13. [ ] Implement more comprehensive input validation for S3 API parameters
14. [ ] Add more detailed logging throughout the application for better debugging
15. [ ] Refactor XML serialization/deserialization to use more type-safe approaches
16. [ ] Improve exception handling and error messages
17. [ ] Implement more robust cleanup of temporary files
18. [ ] Add comprehensive JavaDoc to all public APIs
19. [ ] Refactor controller classes to reduce code duplication
20. [ ] Implement more thorough validation of S3 object metadata

## Performance Improvements

21. [x] Optimize file storage for large objects

24. [ ] Improve multipart upload performance
25. [x] Reduce memory usage when handling large files
26. [ ] Optimize XML serialization/deserialization
27. [x] Keep object metadata storage as plain text (JSON) for inspectability (decided against more efficient/binary storage)

36. [ ] Improve SSL/TLS configuration and certificate management
37. [ ] Implement proper input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
38. [ ] Add support for VPC endpoint policies
39. [ ] Implement proper access logging
40. [ ] Add support for AWS CloudTrail-style audit logging
